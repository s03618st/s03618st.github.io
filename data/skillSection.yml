  ## Why Sōseki?

  Sōseki uses cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) technology to abstract meaning from text.


  Allowing employees to access smoothly all the knowledge stored in the organization is key in accelerating business. Today’s workplace produces a lot of information. Employees are overwhelmed and cannot access the right information at the right time.


  For a long time, computer systems have helped employees navigate through the information through keyword search technology. Such systems do not understand the text. Therefore, it is unable to help staff who do not have enough literacy to use the right words and phrases. However, by using NLP technology that enhances deep-learning,  AI’s are now able to comprehend text. It can provide search results and answers that reflect the staff’s intentions.


  Sōseki has the potential to solve various information needs in business. We look forward in working with you in finding new applications for Sōseki.
